  <h1 class="text-center">About Me</h1>

  <p class="text-center">
    Hi, my name is Quang Vo. I'm a software engineer. Thanks for taking the time to checkout my website. And sorry in advance if the site has any broken links or some portions look a bit plain. I decided to build the entire website myself rather than use
    a theme because well, I am a web developer... I eventually plan to make this site look awesome. Be sure to come back and check out the progress over the next coming weeks.
  </p>
  <p class="text-center">
    Anyway, about me. I'm definitely not the most seasoned developer out there. I think by most people's standards, I'm pretty green. But I definitely strive to be a great developer. I program all day. Even in my freetime. I always make a effort to employ
    best practices and not compromise the quality of my code. I always use modular design and think about how to reuse my code while avoiding redundancy.
  </p>
  <p class="text-center">
    I'm an extremely versatile developer. I feel comfortable using at least 5-6 languages. I can definitely move around and develop in ones I'm only proficient at as well. As I develop and get more familiar with my day to day routines, I have
    a natural tendency to make them more efficient. This usually entails using new paradigms, acquiring new tools, libraries and APIs. And if it doesn't exist, I'm not opposed to making them myself. I'm a software engineer, afterall. I think automation
    is fun. If if think I can automate it, I'll definitely give it a try.
  </p>
