  <h1 class="text-center">About the Site</h1>

  <p class="text-center">
    This site is a mash up of several frameworks, languages and technologies.  It's a Jekyll Blog on Github Pages based on the Ruby programming language.  Jekyll uses markdown and liquid templating.  Markdown is the language you will find in read me pages on github.  Liquid is the template system popularized by ecommerce giant Shopify.  Some of the pages use Bootstrap because they were designed prior to the creation of this blog.
  </p>
  <p class="text-center">
    This blog uses Travis.ci for continuous integration.  It's html is validated.  lol...  Everytime there is a syntax error from new code uploaded to the site, I get an email informing me that there was a build error.
  </p>
  <p class="text-center">
    As I upload more of my work, several languages more languages will find there way here.  And I think that's great.  I don't intend for this website to adhere to any single school of thought or paradigm.  I want this website to be a geniune expression of my love for all things related to computer science.
