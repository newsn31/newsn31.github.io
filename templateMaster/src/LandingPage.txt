        Grumpy wizards make toxic brew for the evil Queen and Jack. One morning,
        when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed
        in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if
        he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed
        and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to
        cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully
        thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as
        he looked. One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he
