        <a style="color:gray;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IQ1qfvXIHU">Proxy VNC</a></a>
        <br>* My Graduate Project. Proxy VNC ported the long-established remote computing system, Virtual Network Computing (VNC), to a web application housed entirely within a browser. The implementation required no additional plugins such as Flash or Java and integrated seamlessly into already existing web infrastructures. It uses a network of proxy servers to improve security and availability and  bypasses NATs and firewalls.

    <ul style="list-style-type: none;" class="text-center">
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhMhn5MPr-A">Shakebox</a>
        <br>* Shakebox was a project which monitored seismic activity readings throughout California.  Seismic sensors were used to measure vibrations in x, y, and z dimensions and those measurements were imported into a database where they eventually were uploaded to the CalTech Community Seismic Network. I developed the language translation modules, the database connectors as well as the visualization software.

    <ul style="list-style-type: none;" class="text-center">
      <li><a href="https://youtu.be/ElU_eQ5DEt4?t=55">BDD Style Browser Automation Testing Video</a>
        <br>* This is automated browser testing across multiple browsers. The demo shows the automation of adding a configurable product to cart and selecting its various inputs and a play by play text output of the current step in the console window. Utilizes
        Selenium Grid, Codeception Testing Framework and Behavioral Driven Design.
      </li>
      <li><a style="color:gray;" href="#">Bash/Python Asyncronous Webcrawler and Image Extractor (uploading soon)</a>
        <br>* This is another more recent webcrawler I created. It uses Python to crawl asyncronous webpages. A combination of Bash, Sed, Awk, Grep and Find scripts are used to process the data retreived and import them into excel sheets. This was created
        to find all the ecommerce tracking codes on the EmazingLights and iHeartRaves website. Images were also pulled and ranked by dimension and size to identify which images were not optimized.
      </li>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J80ryxbvj6w">PHP WebCrawler Video</a>
        <br>* This was one of the first web crawlers I created using PHP and wget. It automatically parsed the contents of the job website indeed.com based on search query and location. The top 50 job postings for say software developer in Los Angeles, CA
        were then automatically filed into a MongoDB database. From there, data analytics could be used to retreive things such as the frequency of times a particular programming language appeared in actual job postings or the similarities in job description
        across various fields.
