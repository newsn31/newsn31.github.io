I've been working on this collection of Bootstrap wireframes for a couple of weeks. They were created using <a href="https://github.com/christiannaths/Redacted-Font">redacted font</a> and <a href="https://github.com/imsky/holder">holder.js</a>

I'm still adding to them, I think I'll have at least 40 when I'm done. I just figured I would just keep adding them as I do more projects.  That way I'll usually have a starting point when a client asks for a design.

Check them out here:

I have also been accumulating other resources to expedite my design process.  This is my curated list of design resources that I've been collecting:
