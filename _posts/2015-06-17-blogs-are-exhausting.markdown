I updated the main navigation bar so that there are no 404's on the main page.  I updated some of the relevant social icons.  Added a disclaimer to warn people visiting the site about its current status.  Added some of the my previous work and a makeshift about me page.  Neither of these are styled.  Got the build to a passing state on Travis.ci.  

I need to add styling to the some of the main pages to make them look less plain. I'm still working out the inner workings of liquid templating and Jekyll's directory structure.  Also still learning the handles and liquid objects which will let me move around more freely in the code base.  Yea.., it might take me awhile to get this blog to a presentable/passable level.  I guess I'm okay with that.  It feels much more like a hobby than anything else.

Unrelated to the blog, I've been working on building my first Shopify theme, which also uses liquid templating, same as the blog.  Coincidence?  Shopify has a pretty decent deal through the Partners Program which gives you free development environments.  Slowly deconstructing the free themes and refashioning them using the Shopify Timber Theme Framework.
