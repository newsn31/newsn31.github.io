I always see GitHub Page Sites, but I had no idea that they were offered for free.  Free web hosting and a pseudo CDN in GitHub Gists, a free blog and version control.  I have web hosting and I would rather use this.  So I've been slowly finding the time to build this site here and there in my free time.

For some reason, I think WordPress is lame but Jekyll seemingly rocks! There is just something more cool about GitHub and Jekyll.  It's like blogging while coding. 

I don't know if I'll blog indefinitely but I'm pretty sure I've found a permanent home for my webpage.
