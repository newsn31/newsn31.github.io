So I connected my Jekyll Blog to Travis.ci.  lol...  I installed a static code analysis gem 'html-proof' to check the html on the Blog for syntax errors.  Too bad, that I haven't really done too much on the blog yet and most of it is from the initial install.  Well, yea, now my blog has continuous integration.
