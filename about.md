Hi, my name is Quang Vo. I'm a software engineer. Thanks for taking the time to checkout my website. As you can see the website is currently under development.  I don't really have a time frame on when it will look presentable.  This is just a side project that I'm working on in my free time.  I eventually plan to make this site look awesome. Be sure to come back and check out the progress over the next coming weeks.

Anyway, about me. I'm definitely not the most seasoned developer out there. I think by most people's standards, I'm pretty green. But I definitely strive to be a great developer. I program all day. Even in my freetime. I always make a effort to employ best practices and not compromise the quality of my code. I always use modular design and think about how to reuse my code while avoiding redundancy.

I consider myself an extremely versatile developer. I feel comfortable using at least 5-6 languages. And I can definitely move around and develop in ones I'm only proficient at as well. As I develop and get more familiar with my day to day routines, I have a natural tendency to make them more efficient and keep things interesting for me. This usually entails using new paradigms, acquiring new tools, libraries and APIs. I think automation is fun. If if think I can automate it, I'll definitely give it a try. And if it doesn't exist, I'm not opposed to making them myself. I'm a software engineer, afterall.
